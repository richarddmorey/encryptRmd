#' Notice that embed-resources is true in the header, and we include remove_data.lua,
#' which will remove the key. Otherwise, the key is included as a data- attribute in the
#' html source, and we don't want that! See https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/5995#discussion-5322823

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| output_encrypt: key1
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output_encrypt: key2
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Plots

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output_encrypt: key2
boxplot(extra ~ group, data = sleep, main = 'Extra sleep by group')
```
