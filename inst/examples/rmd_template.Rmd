```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

> This is a slightly extended version of the basic Rmarkdown template, but containing encrypted output. Enter the key 'key1' to see the summary table output, and 'key2' to see the plot output.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, output_encrypt = 'key1'}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, output_encrypt = 'key2'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
