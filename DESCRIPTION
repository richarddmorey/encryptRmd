Description: This package extends rmarkdown::html_document to include encrypted content
    chunk outputs with libsodium. When the user enters a key, all outputs encrypted with 
    that key are decrypted and shown. Optionally, the content can be markdown and MathJax
    equations can be rendered after the decryption. The package also provides a DOM event
    so that javascript can be used to transform the decrypted content, if desired.
